            <h2>Are you tired of feeling stuck?</h2>
            <p>You wake up with no energy, no drive, and no clarity about where your life is going.</p>
            <p>You’re constantly overwhelmed by negative thoughts and bad habits that keep you where you are.</p>

            <p>I know this because I’ve been there. I was stuck, depressed, and drowning in self-doubt. My weight, my mindset, and my energy levels were at an all-time low. I thought I would NEVER turn my life around.</p>

            <h2>One year ago…</h2>
            <p>I was obese, depressed, and aimless. I remember looking in the mirror and feeling nothing but shame and hopelessness. I wanted to change, but I didn’t know where to start.</p>
            <p>Over the next year, I committed to learning everything I could about nutrition, fitness, mental clarity, and building positive habits. Step by step, I turned my life around. I lost 70 pounds, I discovered my passion, and I became more energized and focused than ever before.</p>
            <p>Now, I’ve created 0 -> Hero to help YOU do the same—no matter where you’re starting from.</p>
